During my study Creative Technology at the University of Twente I got very interested in the combination of art and technology. I fell in love with the idea of creating an artwork that would directory respond to the people viewing it.

I really wanted to use a Kinect to achieve this because it can track people's body movements without needing to hook up any sensors to them. This means anyone can interact with the installation and the barrier to entry is as low as it can be.
