Supernova is an interactive art installation that is all around you. People are invited to stand underneath a large canvas suspended in mid air. Their interactions with the canvas shape the visual effects around them.

For this project I placed four Kinect depth sensors above the canvas. By combining the depth information together in a smart way it is possible to create a live 3D model of the ever changing canvas. It then becomes possible to couple people's interactions to visual effects around them.

The projections were created by two projectors placed above the canvas. This posed an interesting challenge because the surface that was being projected on was constantly moving. To keep the visual effects in a stable location a custom dynamic projection mapping algorithm was developed.
