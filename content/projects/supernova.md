Supernova is an interactive art installation, where people are literally surrounded by interactive visualisations. A large canvas is suspended in mid air. People are invited to come underneath, where their interactions with the canvas shape the visual effects that they see.

The project was build using TouchDesigner, and custom OpenGL shaders. The canvas is tracked using four Kinects placed above it. The projections come from two large beamers placed above the installation.
