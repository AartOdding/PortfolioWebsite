At Gogbot 2018 I presented the continuation of the interactive installation that I build for my graduation project. The technology powering the interactivity in the installation was still the same, but for Gogbot I developed completely new visual effects. 

During my graduation I did user tests with multiple different effects to find out what people liked the most. With this information I created new effects which had more coherency together as one installation.
