ZigZag is one of my big ongoing software projects. It is a tool for creating realtime rendered graphics, particularly suitable for the creation of interactive installations. It is based on the idea of analog video synthesizers. A program can be created by patching together different modules that perform operations on the data flowing through them. Data types and modules can be can be programmed, or takes from a library of default types.
