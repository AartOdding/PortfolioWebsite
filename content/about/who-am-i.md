Hello! My name is Aart. I made this website to show you the things that I do and that interest me. I am a programmer living in the Netherlands, but I do much more than just programming. I love using code for creative purposes, and creating interactive experiences.

I use this website mostly for my larger projects and my blog. I also make a lot of Demo-like visuals which you can view on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aart_odding/).
