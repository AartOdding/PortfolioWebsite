My name is Aart. I am a 3D graphics programmer always striving to combine my technical knowledge with creativity to build fun, interactive and artistic projects.

Professionally I mostly work on 3D geometry manipulation algorithms. I love working on challenging problems, and creating performant and maintainable code. I have set up multiple large projects from the ground up and am no stranger to the entire lifecycle of software development and complex codebases.

To see some of the previous projects I have worked on check out the [projects](/projects) page on this website, or check out one of my socials:
