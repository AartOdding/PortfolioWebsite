Hello! My name is Aart. I am a freelance graphics programmer with a strong passion for  

I made this website to show you the things that I do and that interest me. I am a programmer from the Netherlands, but I do much more than just programming. I love using code for creative purposes, and creating interactive experiences with technology. I use this website mostly to show the projects that I make, but I also make a lot of Demo-like visuals which you can see on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aart_odding/).
