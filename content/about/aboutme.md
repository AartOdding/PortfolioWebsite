My name is Aart, I am a freelance programmer from the Hague, the Netherlands. 

My passion lies in creative coding. I love creating interactive art projects with code. I have also spend a great deal of time creating tools to aid the design process of creative coding projects.

I have worked for multiple companies professionally in the past years, where I have mainly focused on creating high performance and reliable user interfaces.
