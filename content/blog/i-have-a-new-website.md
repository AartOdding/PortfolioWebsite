And if you are reading this you are on it.

I chose to use a static site generator (Hugo) for this website, and it's been a really  good experience. My old website was using wordpress and I would always run into limitations. Wordpress has a very inflexible structure, and if you want to customize your website you either needs lots of plugins, or hack your way around the wordpress code. Neither of which I like. 

Using Hugo is a lot more like writing traditional web pages in html and css. The only difference is that you do not write every page manually but that you write templates for web pages that you can later fill in with your content. This has many advantages, but for me the biggest ones are:

* It is customizable (basically you write html and css).

* It is very fast (wordpress has to build your website for every visitor).

* It can be hosted for free (because there is no server side code).

* Version control is much better, because you can use Github.

Because I use netlify to automatically deploy my website from Github, it is also open source. You can see the source code if you click on the Github icon in the top menu.
