During my bachelor's degree Creative Technology I fell in love with programming. Naturally when finished and not sure what to do next I chose to do a masters in Computer Science. When I decided to quit earlier this year most people were surprised or did not really understand my decision. I was not doing bad and passing all my subjects. I even thought it was quite fun. Why would I just quit?

There was of course multiple reasons that made me quit, but the overarching reason was that continuing to study just didn't feel right. I'm writing this blogpost to give words to those reasons, and for myself to internalize those feelings.

First of all I did not actually like the degree as much as I thought I would. There are many why I love programming, but during my masters I did not encounter many of them.

I like solving hard problems, and thinking of algorithms to do so, but during my masters I almost never did this. Most of the time we use tools build by other people, to solve problems that have already been solved anyway. 

I like thinking about what is good and bad programming. When I design a program I think about structure, naming, design patterns etc. In university it almost as if this does't exist. No one actually cares about the quality of your code. 

I like using code for creative purposes, but the assignment I had to do where already defined for me, and creative freedom was nowhere to be found.

I think this is all due to the fact that during a masters you don't learn about computer science anymore. Instead you apply computer science to different research areas. This is great if there are research areas that you are very interested in, but this was unfortunately not the case for me.

Besides these reasons why I did not like the study, I also had no time to do the stuff I love doing. Both personal/ hobby wise, and programming/ design wise. I feel that there is so much potential in the intersection between art and technology, and right now I finally have the time to explore that. 

And the best thing is: Right now I'm learning more stuff than I ever would have during my masters programme.
