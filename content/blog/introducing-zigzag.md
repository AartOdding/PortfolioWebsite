In the past few months I have been working on my latest project: ZigZag. Zigzag is a tool for creating realtime rendered computer graphics. The idea of this program is to allow people to create applications based on realtime rendered graphics, without many of the hassles that come with programming such a project. Especially for interactive installations ZigZag will be a very valuable tool.

The initial idea for ZigZag came from seeing the possibilities for graphics programming that analog visual synthesizers give you. I wanted to create a sort of program where different modules filter the signals that pass through them. The modules would be connected with patch cables to allow for complex visual effects.

Then I found out about the existence of TouchDesigner. TouchDesigner had a lot of the features I wanted to see in my own program, so I decided to just learn that instead of taking the time to build my own program. However as I was getting more and more comfortable with TouchDesigner I started seeing things that I would have liked differently. Witth that ZigZag was started.

Right now ZigZag is still in a very early phase of development with no official releases yet. However a lot of the core features are already in place (as can be seen in the picture above). 

One very important idea in ZigZag is customizability. ZigZag is just a framework, but all the content can be made by the user. It comes with a standard library of data types and operators, but these could have just as well been made by the user. ZigZag is also open source. Of course it is a very large project, and I hope that eventually a community will form to develop ZigZag together.

Keep your eye out for ZigZag's first official release! Follow the progress: <https://github.com/AartOdding/ZigZag>
